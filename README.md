# Car-sharing Project

Recently, in order to help grow my car sharing business, I built a serverless application that pulled, warehoused, and analyzed/visualized data from a carsharing website - using only a third party scraping tool and Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

AWS services used:
- Glue
- Lambda
- CloudWatch
- S3
- API Gateway
- RDS
- VPC
- QuickSight

Primary languange used: Python.
