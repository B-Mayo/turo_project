Take advantage of this NEW LISTING (turo doesn’t event have it ready for app input!)

?? This is a beautiful Loaded 2019 G550. The Mercedes-Benz G-Class is the automotive equivalent of, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" The iconic Geländewagen has been around since 1979, with only evolutionary updates keeping it fresh over the past four decades. It's weird and wild, and there's nothing else quite like it.

With a pedigree so storied, the G Class is a true legend of the road.

It has an ubiquitous 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine, tuned here to deliver 416 horsepower and 450 pound-feet of torque. That's more than enough hustle to get this big, four-wheel-drive brute up and moving with a quickness. Mercedes estimates the 0-60 miles per hour time at under 6 seconds

The G Class comes with a 12.3-inch infotainment display, front and center, set back in the dash. 

- heated seats 
- ventilated seats 
- apple play 
- wireless charging
- massage seats 
- Upgraded surround sound

This vehicle is a non smoker

Bob Lutz, you know...the GM product czar, smote the earth and up sprang the Kappa platform, a fascinating hydroformed steel tubes and stampings, aluminum control arms, and GM-premium parts. Car and Driver Magazine attested to it's sporty chassis ""which kept the car flat and planted while chasing hairpins in the Santa Monica Mountains behind Malibu"".  There's no denying how beautiful they designed this puppy, a must drive to feel what a roadster should be.  Get ready to skydrive with the rare Saturn SKY!  Definitely one of the funnest convertible in the fleet.  

*Please note that this vehicle's design has a small 5.4 cubic ft. trunk space.  Also, like all sports cars they do have firmer suspensions. 

*Like all convertibles, please let the roof dry before putting it down to avoid rusting thank you for your consideration!

There is limited trunk space in the rear and side areas of the trunk

Rear dimensions- 23”W x 16”L x 9”H
Side dimensions- 7”W x 24”L x 11”H

Portable GPS available upon request.

2018 Tesla Model 3 Long Range

We are located in Buckhead, GA and are willing to organize airport or custom delivery as necessary.
Here is your opportunity to try out the brand new 2018 Tesla Model 3! With over 400,000 reservations, there is a year + long waiting list for this vehicle.  

This Model 3 features the best performance and longest range battery pack options. The all electric range is 310 miles with Supercharging capabilities. The Tesla Superchargers restore the batter to full power around 7 dollars and take under 1 hour. Superchargers are available at Atlantic station, the Decatur Tesla store and Lenox Mall. You can also charge at almost any public charging station or any normal electric outlet.

Enhanced Autopilot is enabled on this car.  Autopilot is a driver assistance feature which still requires you to have your hands on the wheel and be ready to take over driving at any moment.  Please review the Autopilot safety information in the manual on the touchscreen prior to activating the feature.

The incredible high power motor accelerates you from 0-60 in under 5 seconds!  And without shifting or noise, it feels like a spaceship.  Combine this with a futuristic interior and large displays, this vehicle is sure to impress.

This Model 3 is equipped with a driver facing camera.  There is no live owner/driver video feed but be aware Tesla may be able to access the logs with footage from that camera.  There are also 7 exterior cameras used for the Autopilot system and 1 backup camera when putting the car in reverse.

You may return the vehicle with at least 25% charge to incur no recharging fee.  If you return it with 10-24% the recharging fee of $25 will be submitted for reimbursement.  At no point should you allow the battery to fall below 10%.

There is no smoking of any kind allowed in the car, please treat it as if it were your own car.

Features:
Autopilot with Full Self Driving option
74kw longest range battery pack (310+ miles)
Premium Package
Red Paint over Black leather interior

DELIVERY TO YOU SERVICE 
Willing to pick up and drop off at all metro stations and airports in the area (Reagan DCA and Dulles). I can also drop off and pick up the vehicle at local major mall areas. 
 Will deliver to BWI only if rental is longer than a week and a half otherwise it's too far.  Will also deliver to your house, but then I ask that you please drop me off at the nearest metro station in VA, Bethesda, Fairfax or Tyson Corner and let me pick up from a metro station in which case I will drop you off at your home.

AVAILABILITY - DROP OFF &amp; PICKUP TIMES
Because of my day job drop offs and pickups Monday through Friday can only happen between 6:30pm - 10:30pm or before 7:15 (8am if near DC downtown or near a Virginia Blue line metro stop) in the morning except if you drop off at my house then although I have to meet you to give you the car you could drop off whenever you want. I will be available the most on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays for easy delivery pickup and drop off logistics.

Charging cost is about $10-$15 for 260 mileage range. You will get an invoice charge receipt within 1 day at the end of your return. Please do not leave the charger plug in beyond it’s complete charge or else you will incur an idle charging fee.

Bonus Savings: I read a lot about investments. If you ask me about a random public company above $100M valuation(must have earnings) and I don’t know it, then I’ll take $40 off your total. Beat me in chess, and I’ll take off $60 your total. Potential savings of $100.

The car must be returned clean according to Turo policy (in the same condition when pickup up).  If not cleaning convenience fee will be incurred. The car can be taken to any wash station, please provide the receipt of this before returning vehicle. This is also a specialty vehicle with 200 miles per day allowance. Please avoid running the battery to no charge (50 miles or less) as it is detrimental to the life of the battery.  Please plan to charge stations accordingly if you plan to rent for several days.  Absolutely no track or off-road use.Also, please note it is easy to scratch/curb the wheels on this vehicle.  Damaged wheels cost a minimal $200 to refinish.

Please return the vehicle with the battery outside the keyfob.  RF pouches do not block the key signal sufficiently.1) Return the car with at least the same charge as you received it. Returning with less than original charge will incur a charge of $0.40 per kWh. Returning the car with a low charge (less than 60 miles) will incur a $60 convenience fee on top of the kWh charge because I'll need to go charge it at the supercharger. Returning the car with VERY low charge (under 30 miles) will incur a $100 convenience fee at a minimum (more if the car needs to be towed). Idle fees (up to $1.00 per minute) are applied to cars occupying a Supercharger after completing a charging session.2) You are welcome to take the car to a supercharger, but keep in mind that Tesla charges for supercharging the Model 3. If you do supercharge it, I'll just charge you .25kwh, which is about $15-$25 max for 260miles.3) No pets in the car.4) No smoking or eating, or drinking (drinking water is okay) in the car.  5) Don't put anything in the car that would leave a smell or residue.6) If anything is spilled in the car, you'll be charged to do an interior detail on the car (more if the cleaning is really involved). 7) Watch out about scratching the leather in the car. I've had renters in the past who have scratched it from keys in their pockets scratching the seat or rings on their hands scratching the steering wheel.

Model X is the safest, fastest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history. With all-wheel drive and a 90 kWh battery providing 250 miles of range and free charging all over the country.  Model X has ample seating for six adults and all of their gear. And it’s ludicrously fast, accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in as quick as 4.8 seconds (same as a Porsche 911)Model X is the SUV un-compromised.

I am a Tesla enthusiast; I'm very familiar with the company ; the S, X and 3 and all options. I don't work for them but I should. When you rent from me you'll either get a minimum of a 15 minute how to tutorial just enough to stay safe and understand charging etc.  however a lot of people who rent Tesla's want one and it's like an extended test drive to learn more.  If that's the case I am happy to spend as much time as you'd like going over all the features.

You will be provided Tesla tutorial and walk through videos upon booking for your information and to ensure you spend the maximum time enjoying your rental.  There are some differences but after an hour of driving everyone has said it's easier and better than anything they've experienced before.  There is a reason that Tesla has a 97% satisfaction rate with owners - its very easy and intuitive to use all features.

LOADED WITH ALL THE OPTIONS YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A SUBURBAN LIKE THIS

A convoy of one, this loaded tester (black with high-gloss black 22-inch wheels, naturally) carries its nearly three-tons of Texas-built all-American bulk with confidence. The long, crisp exterior lines of the most recent redesign are holding up very well, and the interior has benefitted from all the recent material quality improvements -- and features from heated and cooled seats to wireless smartphone chargers -- that we’ve praised in GM’s late model pickups.

Speaking of those trucks, this is, despite the shared GMT K2XX SUV/pickup platform, clearly no longer a gussied up Silverado with a permanent cap on the back. Depending on what you’re expecting to get out of the Suburban ownership experience, that’s either a good thing or a bad thing. Ride is a little better than in an unladen Silverado, for example, but towing capacity maxes out at 8,000 pounds -- well below the nearly 6 tons that is attainable with a max trailering package-equipped 4WD double cab pickup.",90020,none,5.0,"Gas (Premium)","['No smoking or pets allowed in the car.

In spite of that, it is a true experience to drive. Incredibly relaxing and serene. Ignore the hectic world outside and waft along in true luxury. They just don't build cars like this anymore. Shut the door once and you'll immediately know what I mean. 

This is an expensive car to rent for a reason. You just won't find another like it and I hope to rent to responsible adults who know what this car is about. Perfect for weddings, important meetings (make a lasting impression beyond your typical Camry rental) and special occasions. Huge back seat- that is heated and reclines.

The overall driving dynamics also offer an enjoyable time when the highway ends and the curvy roads begin with the DSG dual-clutch gearbox running through the gears quickly and efficiently to keep the power on tap"" (Car and Driver). And if the automatic mode is not enough, there are sport and sport/manual modes with paddle shifters on the wheel.

Designed as a family car without compromise, Model X comes standard with all-wheel drive, ample seating for up to seven adults, standard active safety features, and up to 295 miles of range on a single charge. And it's the quickest SUV in production.

Model X has the most storage room of any sport utility vehicle in its class, and seating for up to seven adults. Designed to maximize passenger comfort, the second and third row in the seven-seat option are capable of folding flat and flush, creating extra cargo space.

The Safest SUV Ever
Model X is the safest SUV ever, with standard active safety features and hardware built to provide visibility that a driver cannot access alone. Eight surround cameras allow for 360-degree vision, while twelve ultrasonic sensors provide detection of surrounding objects. Forward-facing radar see through heavy rain, fog, dust, and beyond the vehicle ahead—helping to prevent accidents by providing simultaneous visibility in every direction. Model X is the first SUV ever to achieve a 5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category, the lowest probability of occupant injury, and a rollover risk half that of any SUV on the road.

Clean-Air Cabin
Medical-grade air quality is delivered through a HEPA filtration system, specifically designed to prevent viruses and bacteria from entering the cabin. There are three modes: circulate with outside air, re-circulate inside air, and a bioweapon defense mode – which creates positive pressure inside the cabin to protect occupants.

All Tesla vehicles produced have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.

Software Updates
All Tesla vehicles with Enhanced Autopilot and the latest software update now have improved capabilities, including; Autosteer up to 90 mph, Auto Lane Change, Summon (beta), Lane Departure Warning and Automatic Emergency Braking.

Falcon Wing Doors

Each door is equipped with sensors to monitor the proximity of surroundings and smoothly open, up and out of the way – providing wide openings for parents to comfortably buckle children in, without straining or bumping their child's head on the roof.

? FREE curbside delivery and/or self-service at DFW or DAL (Lovefield) Airports**
? Pre-loaded NTTA TollPass for use in all of Texas &amp; Oklahoma

?????????? 2018 Audi A4 Edmunds.com review:
The 2018 Audi A4 delivers just about everything we expect from a small luxury sedan. There's quick acceleration, a comfortable ride, and the latest connectivity and navigation technologies. But the fact that it does it without overwhelming you makes it, at least for the time being, the car to get in the segment.

The A4 is a joy to drive, whether you're slicing your way through mountain switchbacks or just tackling your daily commute. On the inside, Audi's understated yet attractive interior design makes operating all of the many high-tech features easy, thanks to the intuitive MMI infotainment system and smartly placed physical buttons for more common functions. To top it off, the A4 also provides plenty of space and comfort for front and rear passengers, accommodating even taller adults in back.

Trust us, you'll want this car on your short list.

This isn’t your everyday Audi, this is a R8!

It sounds amazing, it’s insanely fun to drive, and exhilarating... all at the same time. This is one Turo trip you won’t forget!  White on gun metal gray wheels, with the carbon fiber package. 


Here’s a little more about the R8:
- It has 2 door, and 2 seats 

- It’s instantly powerful. Not recommend for the faint at heart.

- It does have a front trunk, and will hold a small suitcase or a couple duffle bags 

- It has all the premium features you’ve come to expect: Navigation, insane sound system, Satellite radio, Bluetooth, and leather seats

- The car extremely low, so you should have experience in handling a “lower” car. If not, you might end up taking off the front bumper... or at least damaging it 

- Because of the power, it requires 91 octane gas. Put anything less, and you’ll cause problems. Please don’t do that! 

- It’s very powerful. Experience handling high horsepower car is a must!

-Premium Package with High Fidelity Sound and Tan Leather Seats

SIBLING RIVALRY
People naturally assume Jouley is as mild mannered as her older sister, Tessy - especially since they're both Model S's and sport the same 85kWh battery pack. But Jouley hates that. To her, there is no comparison. It's all about bragging rights! She knows she was made to go fast and stand out. She longs for more and settles for nothing less. Though the sisters may look the similar on the outside, you'll probably find Jouley to be a bit more than you bargained for.

POWER
The first mistake newcomers make with Jouley? Underestimating just how hard she'll throw you back in your seat - even when you think you're ready. Though she lacks the brain-liquefying capabilities of the more modern 100kWh family, Jouley puts out 470 horsepower and 443 lbs of torque - over 120 ft-lbs more than Tessy. 

The second mistake? Thinking she'll let you get away with 250 miles of range. You'll find her silently begging you to ride her just a little harder and harder each time you step on the pedal. The exhilaration comes at a price: the harder she works to keep you satisfied and smiling, the sooner she needs R&amp;R (rest and recharge)! 

Know what you're dealing with.

SPEED
At 4,647 lbs, Jouley's got a hundred pounds over Tessy. A hundred extra pounds of raw, unadulterated talent. With a 0-60mph of 3.9 seconds, you'll find her hanging out with the supercar crowd, with the occasional Corvette and Viper. She still maintains the equivalent of 90 miles per gallon (and like Tessy, she's a 4-door sedan).

APPEARANCE
Jouley's always dressed for success. She's a deep, metallic blue. She loves wearing her 21-inch high wheels. The slipstream design of her shoes proudly shows off her shiny calipers, painted red. Her carbon fiber rear spoiler sits atop her trunk, subtly complementing her smooth, curvy lines that draw your eyes right down to her... license plate. With her panoramic glass roof, you'll certainly enjoy your adventures with full-view. But please keep your eyes on the road.

There's no sugar coating it, Jouley commands attention!

EXPERIENCE &amp; EQUIPMENT
Looks can be deceiving. Though she's younger than Tessy, Jouley has far more experience putting smiles on her rider's faces. Despite her feisty behavior, she strangely shares her sister's taste for submission (it must be a generation-thing!). She much prefers when you're in control of the wheel, and will never assume to know what you want. No AutoPilot or adaptive cruise control on this one! Jouley is armed with GPS, 4G LTE internet connection (where available) and standard cruise-control, so she can take you anywhere within the US you want to go. Except off-roading. She hates that, too 

Who says business travel has to be boring?

The Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera (""SuperLight"") Edizione' debuted in the Geneva Auto Show with a windfall of acclaim to true driver enthusiasts.  The name also paid tribute to the construction style of the first Lamborghini 350GT, designed and built by the famous Carrozzeria Touring.  With extreme emphasis on weight reduction, the Superleggera was lighter by an amazing 100 kg (220 lb) via the use of carbon fiber panels for the rear diffuser, undertray, the rearview-mirror housings, the interior door panels, the central tunnel, engine cover; titanium wheel nuts and carbon fibre sports seats. The engine power was upgraded by 10 PS (7 kW; 10 hp) via improved intake, exhaust and ECU for a total of 530 PS (390 kW; 523 hp). 

...and anotther thing you probably need to know about driving the Superleggera...YOU BETTER BELIEVE EVERYONE WILL BE LOOKING AT YOU BECAUSE OF HOW GOOD LOOKING YOU REALLY ARE =)

The Chevrolet Camaro 2 SS with dual mode exhaust is a fully loaded monster. Enjoy cooled &amp; heated seats w upgraded sound &amp; navigation. The 8 gear Automatic has near instant shifts. The transmission can sense your driving, when revved will enter sport shift mode to maintain the lowest gear possible. When driving smooth, the engine will turn off 4 cylinders to achieve about 30 MPG highway. The car is capable of turning at 1 G &amp; the heads up display has G force measurement so you never turn too hard. The driving experience is superior to the corvette in my opinion as it feels bigger and safer although they weigh the same.

***INSURANCE INFORMATION***
I get a ton of emails about how much insurance costs. Insurance is available from Turo. Turo Provides liability insurance in your rental fee but does offer additional coverage for an extra fee. This is between you and Turo and is handled at checkout. Please do not contact me with insurance questions. Contact Turo.

***Important Notes:***
1) The car is equipped with an eco stop/start function and the engine will turn off when the car is stopped. the engine will resume as soon as you lift your foot off the brake. This is normal operation for this vehicle. 

2) We again ask that there be NO smoking in this vehicle! (Cleaning Fee will apply)

With its special Cooper Custom themed TANGy ORANGE stripes, this Mini has some pop that will turn heads and stand out over other plain black striped Minis on the road - NOT for the faint of heart...
 
We absolutely love this spunky car! The retro inspired convertible is a blast from the past with a modern twist! Bluetooth, Auxiliary, adjustable Ambient Lighting, Push Start ignition, Push Slip key, heated seats and an eco friendly motor that gets great gas mileage.  

As a 4-seater, the feeling is simply fun and good times with friends!  You can always throw extra luggage in the back seat but friends are easily more entertaining.  No worries it still has a separate trunk, a mini one of course.  

*Like all convertibles, please let the roof dry before putting it down to avoid rusting, as well as activate only after the engine is running to prevent any malfunctions thank you for your consideration!

Portable GPS available upon request.

At only 89k miles my GMC Envoy XUV is a logical extension of the revolutionary Chevrolet Avalanche, with an easier to use midgate and a new twist to further the ""SUV or pickup?"" flexibility. Built on the same basic platform as the TrailBlazer, the Envoy has a pleasant, well-designed five-passenger interior and a cargo space that can be enclosed - or not, as you wish. It also incorporates a new, flexible tailgate which can open down or from the side.
The Envoy's main feature is its conversion, so let's look at that first, and address the powertrain later. The main cab of the Envoy is separated from its cargo bay by a clear glass window which can be raised or lowered independently from an overhad control in the cab; the seats have the familiar flip and fold feature, and behind the seatbacks is a gate which, like the Avalanche's midgate, can be folded out of the way, enabling the Envoy to have a long cargo bed when needed, and five seats at other times. Unlike the Avalanche, the Envoy's window glass does not need to be removed; it simply slides into the midgate making it much simpler to convert the truck.",75146,SLT,5.0,"Gas (Regular)","[""I do not allow smoking in the vehicles at all.

With excellent performance, technology, efficiency, and comfort, there's not much you won't like about this car.

? FREE curbside delivery and/or self-service at DFW or DAL (Lovefield) Airports**
? Pre-loaded NTTA TollPass for use in all of Texas &amp; Oklahoma

?????????? 2018 Audi A4 Edmunds.com review:
The 2018 Audi A4 delivers just about everything we expect from a small luxury sedan. There's quick acceleration, a comfortable ride, and the latest connectivity and navigation technologies. But the fact that it does it without overwhelming you makes it, at least for the time being, the car to get in the segment.

The A4 is a joy to drive, whether you're slicing your way through mountain switchbacks or just tackling your daily commute. On the inside, Audi's understated yet attractive interior design makes operating all of the many high-tech features easy, thanks to the intuitive MMI infotainment system and smartly placed physical buttons for more common functions. To top it off, the A4 also provides plenty of space and comfort for front and rear passengers, accommodating even taller adults in back.

?????????? 2018 Audi A4 Edmunds.com review:
The 2018 Audi A4 delivers just about everything we expect from a small luxury sedan. There's quick acceleration, a comfortable ride, and the latest connectivity and navigation technologies. But the fact that it does it without overwhelming you makes it, at least for the time being, the car to get in the segment.

The A4 is a joy to drive, whether you're slicing your way through mountain switchbacks or just tackling your daily commute. On the inside, Audi's understated yet attractive interior design makes operating all of the many high-tech features easy, thanks to the intuitive MMI infotainment system and smartly placed physical buttons for more common functions. To top it off, the A4 also provides plenty of space and comfort for front and rear passengers, accommodating even taller adults in back.

Equipped with the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, this car is one of the best cars in its class for delivering both impressive acceleration and high fuel economy. Inside, it has plenty of room for passengers, clever storage solutions and more cargo space than most competitors in any body style. It also offers technology features that put some other compact cars to shame and safety ratings that are among the best.

"Liberty Mutual",2006,inglewood,"If you selected Airport Delivery PLEASE READ: This is NOT a direct airport delivery at the gate. 

For LAX Airport this is not a direct airport delivery at the gate It is renter’s responsibility to get to the pick up location and return location. The location is 1.5 mils only a 10 min Uber/Lyft drive from lax airport super convenient for travelers. But if you prefer LAX terminal gate delivery to avoid spending time and Uber/Lyft fee to get to the car, we do have this option with delivery fee. Please choose Guest's chosen location delivery for pick up and return location and set the location as 1 World Way Los Angeles ca 90045  (You can text me the exactly terminal to delivery the vehicle) 

We Highly recommend booking the vehicle without delivery and Ubering yourself to the vehicle, this will save both of us a good amount of time! (and is much cheaper).

Under the rear decklid of the 2010 Turbo is the most powerful, and most fuel efficient, engine the automaker has ever offered in the model's 30-year history. Displacing 3.8-liters, the four-valve all-aluminum flat-six is fitted with direct fuel injection, an expansion-type intake manifold, and two turbochargers with variable turbine geometry. With a mild .8 bar (just under 12 psi) of boost, the engine is rated at an even 500 horsepower and 479 lb-ft of torque.

Porsche has adapted its excellent seven-speed (PDK) dual-clutch transmission for its new role in the 911 Turbo. The PDK gearing is longer for the Turbo, the clutches each have an additional shift plate, and the PDK is now available with a limited-slip differential (unlike the Tiptronic S transmission).

With a six speed transmission, first gear alone will take you north of 60 mph. And while this Viper may not be show car condition - it has a few signs of age - it is RIDICULOUSLY entertaining to drive and gets attention wherever it goes.

Never driven a Viper before? --&gt;Allow us this brief reality check. While the Viper’s a modern classic, it’s not a modern car. IT FEATURES: a manual transmission that can be difficult and unforgiving to stick shift novices, no traction control, no stability control, no side airbags or anti-lock brakes, it’s cramped and scrapes going over most speed bumps. Also, it has no roof, windows or air conditioning. We’ll include a car cover in case of rain.

...are you still with us?

Good. It’ll be a fun day - we promise.

INTERIOR FEATURES: While the Viper really isn’t about creature comforts, it does have comfy seats and an updated stereo system with blue tooth and USB port. 

So what are you waiting for?

No destination required to rent this Viper; to simply drive is reason enough. Book today!

**FREE** Store your regular ride in our gated driveway for hassle-free pick up and drop off.

**Book ahead with confidence: we’ll waive the cancellation fee in cases of inclement weather. (Viper only)

"Liberty Mutual",2017,inglewood,"If you selected Airport Delivery PLEASE READ: This is NOT a direct airport delivery at the gate. 

For LAX Airport this is not a direct airport delivery at the gate It is renter’s responsibility to get to the pick up location and return location. The location is 1.5 mils only a 10 min Uber/Lyft drive from lax airport super convenient for travelers. But if you prefer LAX terminal gate delivery to avoid spending time and Uber/Lyft fee to get to the car, we do have this option with delivery fee. Please choose Guest's chosen location delivery for pick up and return location and set the location as 1 World Way Los Angeles ca 90045  (You can text me the exactly terminal to delivery the vehicle) 

We Highly recommend booking the vehicle without delivery and Ubering yourself to the vehicle, this will save both of us a good amount of time! (and is much cheaper).

"Liberty Mutual",2013,los-angeles,"This 2018 Ford F-150 4 Door 4WD XLT Super Crew Sport package contains all the features that you might need in any situation and is brand new off the showroom lot. With its 3.5L EcoBoost motor and top of the line towing package you can be sure that this beast of a vehicle is super-fast and is a pleasure to drive. Secure yourself in the captain's seat for maximum comfort and driving pleasure. The truck's 4 door design ensures a comfortable ride not only for the driver, but also for up to 4 passengers — its spacious interior will allow everyone inside to relax and enjoy the ride.

This vehicle comes equipped with functionalities such as GPS, Backup Camera, Alexa, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Voice Assistance, Bluetooth, Multiple USB ports, 110 Volt Outlet, privacy tinted windows and much more to ensure that you have everything that you may need while you are driving this truck.

This F-150 is ahead of its competition with powertrain updates for the 2018 model year. The venerable, second-generation 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 comes with more power and torque with an all-new 10-speed automatic transmission helps boost fuel economy and performance. In fact, the EcoBoost moves into its second generation with 50 more pound-feet of torque and 10 more horsepower than before - thanks to the truck's direct and port fuel injection, all-new turbochargers, and a completely new valve-train system that’s also said to cut weight. The result is 375 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque. Ford also added a Stop/Start system as standard feature (can be switched off) to help curb fuel consumption while idling in drive.

While others are developing mundane case studies in urban commuting, Tesla has created a luxury vehicle that captures all the performance, luxury, and technological potential of electric propulsion. This Model X 90D is equipped with a range leading 90kWh battery pack that achieves an EPA- certified range of over 290 miles between charging.

To enhance the performance even further, our Model X come standard with Tesla’s Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive technology, pairing high efficiency motors in the rear and in the front of the vehicle. The result is unparalleled traction control in all conditions and supercar-like acceleration. Zero to 60 mph in as little as 4.2 seconds!

The massive 17” touchscreen replaces the switchgear of a traditional vehicle, and you’ll never reach for your key; door handles silently extend to meet your hand when you approach, and the car is ready to pull away by the time you’re in the seat.

From the land of the rising sun comes this asphalt assassin of the city! With its stealthy prowess, it is able to move from the shadows of the road and quickly park into the most unaccessible of all parking places. Although small in stature, this car has tons of storage space throughout the cabin such as 2 glove boxes for the driver and passenger, which is perfect for storing away ninja stars or smoke bombs. This capable car can outperform Ferrari’s and Lamborghini ‘s in LA congested traffic with its peppy 1.5L 106hp engine, all while you listen to the latest tunes via the auxiliary port. This Yaris is quite simply one cold blooded machine.

No Pets Please

Your dream to drive your dream car has come true. My BMW i8 is the cheapest luxury rental you will ever find. 

 I have been highest reviewed on turo with our quality of service. 

It's an expensive car and we want our customers to enjoy it rather than misusing it. Please take care of the car as you take care of your ride. It's strictly no smoking and any sign of fragrance or spray in car will be considered smoking and will be charged $250. 

Car will be given clean and in great condition I expect you return the same way and cleaning fees is $100. 

Premium gas only if you want we can fill up the car for you when returned and will charge exactly the same price as at gas stations. We will need the receipt as proof of premium gas filled. 

Excellent car for a night out, graduation parties and weddings. 

I will consider all request and car will be rented to anyone approved to drive by turo. Have fun and thank you for your business.

Heads up I have several tracking devices and also have my bmw connect active on this car which lets me know if you are abusing my 150k dollar car in anyway. I can also track this car down within in 10 feet of its location. So no offense but don't do anything stupid that could get you in trouble.

Its whisper quiet to drive. If you turn off the radio, the fan and open up the pano roof on a warm evening, you can just drive with the sound of nature and a bit of wind. Acceleration is as advertised. Regenerative braking is the underappreciated trick this car pulls off. I find myself holding off on the brake as long as possible to see if the car will just slow itself down in time and it does. A car this quick needs to hold your loose stuff.  It is the best car I've ever driven. And it is as good today as when we took it home.

The Model S's standard 17-inch touch screen is remarkable and not just due to sheer size. The screen is easily reconfigurable, bright, vivid, intuitive, and reacts to taps, pinch and drag gestures with snappy immediacy. It is almost certainly the best in-vehicle infotainment system available. 

The design and drive-ability is a wonderful experience.  This car is so much more fun. So quick and nimble. Long trips just take a little planning-no problem! Charging stations are everywhere.

Welcome to Los Angeles!!! This immaculate REDDDDD Ferrari California with tan/black interior is in amazing condition. The color combination is the way a Ferrari should be. It has under 9k miles!  Cruise Los Angeles the way it’s meant to be cruised with this sexy drop top.

Ferrari's smallest car, the California, gets its name from the original 250 California Spyder, of Ferris Bueller fame. It's the carmaker's first retractable hardtop. It’s very driver-friendly and has features like Bluetooth and a navigation system. 

A roaring 4.3-liter V-8 and Formula One-derived stability system is sure to give you a great time! 

Under the Hood is a naturally aspirated, with sky-high horsepower per liter — the California's 4.3-liter V-8 makes 453 hp at a howling 7,750 rpm and 357 pounds-feet of torque at 5,000 rpm. 

The engine sits just behind the front axle and drives the rear wheels through an F1-style seven-speed automated manual transmission that has an automatic shift mode or can be shifted with steering-wheel paddles. 

Safety
Standard safety features include:
Side-impact airbags
Antilock brakes
Electronic stability control
Traction control system

"Liberty Mutual",2006,sterling,"This is the first of the new affordable generation of fully electric vehicles on the market. With (200 to 300) miles of range, it has 2-3x the range of any other electric car on the market in its price range, rivaled only by the much more expensive Tesla model 3. Say goodbye to range anxiety! The range will vary with temperature and your driving style. And it is much much cheaper to rent than any Tesla. And many other cars as well.

While it may not have the futuristic styling of the model 3, it’s got a unique and pleasant interior in its own right. As a 5-door hatchback, it is convenient to get around town with plenty of seating and cargo space.

It charges from empty in about 9 hours on a level 2 charger, but with regular use and charging it doesn't need more than a few hours at a time every few days. And about 45 to 90 minutes on a high voltage charger.

I have a level 2 charger you can use at my house, and there are plenty of other free and cheap level 2 and level 3 charging stations all around the Maryland DC Virginia area. Use an app like 'PlugShare' to find them. It also comes with a regular outlet charger but it takes a few times as long to charge. If you have somewhere to plug it in overnight that's usually enough. I will also provide membership cards for EVGO ChargePoint SemaConnect. The fast charger EVGO is free. You can use PlugShare to plan your stops and travel. I have driven this car on trips of 400 miles in a single day but that does require a small amount of planning.

For DELIVERY! Most renters take the short Uber trip to the car! I can only deliver the car around lunch between 11:30am and 1:30pm on weekdays and possibly during certain times on the weekends. If you can't meet around weekday lunch, the car location is a very short 8 minute Uber ride from DFW! Most renters just Uber to the location since flight arrivals/departures can be unpredictable. Less stress for you when you can get a short/quick ride at your own pace when you're ready. Uber is also quicker and way cheaper than delivery!

You MUST have with you your valid driver's license for me to give you the keys. For insurance and liability purposes, your driver's license must be of the same person listed on the account before the keys are allowed to be handed over. Please set your trip to start earlier than you plan on arriving at the car. Due to liablity, Turo only permits you to drive the car during official trip times. Turo insurance is ONLY in effect during official trip times.

One of my client did a youtube video regarding the car, please check below link to check out the car before renting

TIPS:
* Higher the speed lower will be range. Drive below 70miles/hr which will give 250miles of range and lower 
   speeds get some what better charge.
* For fast charge i recommend Tesla super charger which charges around 180miles in 30mins and will take 
   another 30mins to charge fully to 250miles.
* If planning for long trips please let me know I could suggest best course as I did lot of long drives in Tesla from 
   Dallas.
* If you have any concerns don't hesitate to reach me out, I am happy to answer all your questions.
* Will monitor car occasionally to make sure it does not go out of charging.

CAUTION:
* Please ensure to charge the car before the charge goes below 50miles at any supercharger or other ev chargers. Not doing so will cause the car to be towed to nearest supercharger and you will have to bear all the expenses related to towing chargers. 
* If the charging drops below 50 and need any suggestions regarding charging, please call me i can guide to nearest supercharger or charging station.

This is a more race track focused RCF unlike other street oriented RCF on Turo. 

She is a wolf in sheep clothing. Docile looking from the outside but very quick and nimble when you take her out on the open road and canyon run. Rare chance for one to experience a track focused car.

Now with .......

????Best-in-class Stage II Racing Suspension designed by a legendary racing team. Makes this the best handling RCF on Turo. Offers race car crisp cornering able to pull very high-g’s with ease. In addition the suspension gives massive mechanical grip which translates to quicker acceleration and the car is easier to balance on the edge of what the Michelin 4S tires can handle. I have had a Porsche 911 GT3 owner drive this Lexus and he was completely blown away at the handling. Says a lot!

??Patented on-center 2 Piece Racing Rotors with lower rotational mass for quicker acceleration. The rotors are married to high-torque brake pads for improved braking performance. Will stop on a dime and still give you nine cents change. If not familiar with race track brake pads please be aware this brake pads will squeak, this doesn’t mean in any form or shape the brake pads are worn out. This is a no-compromise braking system.

??the newest Michelin 4S!!??

?? Racing control arms for quick steering response, nimbler handling and braking.

PLEASE DO NOT WASH CAR. I will take care of that on my own at no extra charge to you.
Having said that please abstain from eating or drinking in the car. I maintain a well serviced and impeccably clean car for everyone’s enjoyment so please respect and treat the car as your very own. No smoking ????or Vaping in car ????

Experience the thrill of driving a powerful 467 plus Horsepower V8, 5.0 Liter Naturally aspirated (NA) engine. No turbos that take way the visceral experience.  Exhilarating never ending power as you get higher and higher into the rpm's, full power unleashed at a whopping 7100 rpm. The power is very linear unlike what you experience in a turbo engine and to top it off the sound is glorious. NO wimpy sounding twin turbo V6 engine here. All muscle.

Note:  All modifications done to this RCF have been carefully chosen to increase the performance envelope of the RCF. Not for the faint hearted this RCF will behave more like a race track car then a street car and so it will have its own peculiar characteristics.. The rewards though are an exhilarating driving experience. With the newest updates to this particular RCF you will get Cat-like/Porsche 911 like handling; Japanese reliability &amp; ingenuity; American like muscle: all wrapped in a scintillating Ultra White Silhouette.",90019,Base,5.0,"Gas (Premium)","['***Do not wash car upon return.

This AWD Ford Escape is an awesome SUV that nicely balances sporty handling and ride comfort – a rarity in this segment of vehicles.  While many used SUVs in the class force you to choose between ride comfort and nimble handling, the Escape offers both. All-wheel drive is included in this car too!

The back seats have ample legroom and headroom. There are two complete sets of LATCH car-seat connectors in the rear outboard seats and a tether-only connection in the middle seat. The cabin is stylish and built with high-quality materials.

This Escape comes standard with Ford's voice-activated SYNC system, which includes Bluetooth and a USB port. Also included dual-zone automatic climate control, a 10-speaker Sony stereo system, and the MyFord Touch infotainment system with an 8-inch touch screen and navigation.

Please take note of mileage limits if you wish to avoid Turo charging extra fees. Turo is not the place for saving ""wear and tear"" on your own car by renting someone else's for a long trip. As per the rental agreement, tolls will need to be reimbursed. I will provide you with a receipt from my online toll account of any tolls that were accrued during your rental. Due to the delay some Texas Tolls have before they are posted, reimbursement requests will usually be 48hrs after a trip ends. ANY internal or external damage to the car or missing items listed above or in the photos will be charged back to you with a 20% convenience fee. I don't anticipate this happening though since everyone has been pretty respectful of my cars thus far. Please treat the car as if it were your own and be mindful of the road and your surroundings. Please watch out for any road hazards as well as it is Turo Policy that any flat tires that occur during a renter's trip will be the sole responsibility of the renter to either have either patched or replaced with a tire of equal or greater value (unless the tire was bald).",76051,Limited,5.0,"Gas (Regular)","['No Smoking!

This isn’t your everyday Dodge Charger, this is a Hellcat! 

It Sounds amazing, it’s insanely fun to drive, and a little scary... all at the same time. This is one Turo trip you won’t forget! White on gun metal gray wheels wrapped in Pirelli tires. 

A loaded 2018 with almost every option.

Here’s a little more about the Hellcat:

- It’s instantly powerful. Not recommend for the faint at heart

- Four doors provides plenty of room for up to 4 adults

- The trunk is huge, so it’ll hold suitcases and that kinda of stuff 

- It has all the premium features you’ve come to expect: Navigation, 15 speaker sound system, Satellite radio, Bluetooth, and leather seats

- The stock exhaust is kind of loud. If that’s not your thing, this car isn’t for you

- It’s supercharged V8, so MPGs are about 18-20 on the highway, and about 13-15 in the city 

- It’s very powerful. Experience handling high horsepower car is a must! 

- BONUS: It comes with the 'Red Key' unlocking 707hp!!!

Equipped with the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, this car is one of the best cars in its class for delivering both impressive acceleration and high fuel economy. Inside, it has plenty of room for passengers, clever storage solutions and more cargo space than most competitors in any body style. It also offers technology features that put some other compact cars to shame and safety ratings that are among the best.

Cruise Los Angeles with the top down. This immaculate condition C300 convertible is packed with technology inside and out, and the vehicle includes a 180 degree rear view camera that alleviates any anxiety when it comes to park the pricey drop-top. The folding soft-top retracts in about 20 seconds, and wind noise is minimal, especially when AIRCAP is activated. With the touch of a button, the C300 simultaneously raises a panel above the windshield, and a mesh screen decreases wind noise and increases comfort.

It’s a fun car to drive on twisty back roads and doesn’t feel compromising when navigating through bumpy cobblestone streets. There are adjustable drive modes from economy to sport+ assist you through your driving needs.

The red leather seats, diamond grill, sport package, AMG wheels and mats make it even more special.

Active Driving Assistant is comprised of 4 active safety features: Lane Departure Warning, Frontal Collision Warning, City Collision Mitigation, and Pedestrian Protection. This camera- based system helps prevent or reduce the severity of pedestrian and automotive collisions by using a combination of driver alerts and automatically priming and/or activating the brakes. 

The Head-up Display projects a multi-color image that seems to float beyond the windshield, just below your line of vision. It allows you to monitor preferred travel information, BMW Navigation system directional arrows, Infotainment Functions, Check Control data and more - without taking your eyes off the road.

OK to change lanes? With this feature, a warning triangle in your side-view mirror lights up if there’s a vehicle in your blind spot or approaching at a high speed. If you then start to cross lanes, you will feel a slight vibration in your steering wheel - a secondary caution to remain in your lane.

The Bang &amp; Olufsen High-End Surround Sound System features 16 perfectly integrated loudspeakers that deliver a rich sound. Thanks to the patented Acoustic Lens Technology, every passenger-wherever they are seated in the cabin-enjoys an equal distribution of brilliant sound. And in true BMW style, the Surround Sound System blends aesthetics and function for a truly alluring design.

Active front seats help decrease stiffness or fatigue on long trips. When activated, the seat surface is continuously and imperceptibly raised and lowered from side to side, keeping your spine in motion and exercising various support muscles.

Ventilated front seats gently move air through the micro-perforated leather, helping to keep you comfortable all year long.

Seeing a wide-angle view of your surroundings in the Control Display makes it easier to maneuver in tight spaces and avoid pulling into unseen traffic when emerging from a garage.

Car is extremely low must have experience in driving lowered cars before renting.

Please look at the pictures of the ground clearance.

This GT-R has been fitted with Miura’s recently-released wide-body conversion, which if you glance over might not look any different, but in fact is somewhat evolved from the first version. You may have already noticed the redesigned front bumper with those four large openings on the bar that cross over the center grille. The way the two-piece front fender flares merge with said bumper is new too; there’s a more profiled, curved finishing section which gives more continuity to how it all ties together.

Back to the Pandem aero, Miura has changed up the design of the rear overfenders as well; they don’t extend right up to the door line and the bumper lines as the Version 1 kit does. To me, it actually looks better this way. I know that minimalism is a big thing with this sort of bolt-on look.

Then there’s the rear. The stock bumper remains, but a diffuser section with an in-built fog light has been added.

But I guess when you choose to take a GT-R and transform it in this way, you’re seeking attention. If you’re not, you better get ready for it! I spent most of the weekend driving around some pretty wealthy Beverly Hills neighbourhoods where supercars and even hypercars are commonplace on the road, just to see what reaction I got. It was fun too gets so much attention and prepare to be flocked by random people when parked.


As for the other aspects, I really can’t fault any of the additional aero; there was no impact on the drivability of the GT-R. The wheels and tyres aren’t that much bigger than stock either, and the bump in offset means the increased front and rear tracks actually seem to make the car more planted through the bends and more reactive to steering inputs.

From a front seat perspective, the interior hasn’t really been messed with; it retains all of its comfort and sportiness.",91402,Premium,5.0,Gas,"[""Please take a moment to read.

??Ready for your California needs, a brand new stealth grey 2018 SXT Dodge Challenger. I created the look for this car to have that oldskool challenger vibe with the luxuries of today's modernity. 

Inspiration//
This baby has that aggressive vintage revival feel. All the aesthetic modifications has been performed to give definition to the sleek and muscular lines of the body panels. I saw a great packaging for some aftershave at a NYC boutique and was inspired by that. I stuck with really classic colors and parts that will make you take control of the road. Plug in your phone to the USB and enjoy Apple carplay. You won't find another one like this on Turo. Easy on the eyes and super reliable, this is a great choice for you whether you're riding around town or taking the long road.

"Liberty Mutual",2016,dallas,"This is a brand new 2018 Audi A4 2.0T Premium fresh off the lot ready for drivers! We believe this is a class-leading vehicle (and Edmunds agrees, see review below). With excellent performance, technology, efficiency, and comfort, there's not much you won't like about this car. The 12.3 inch Audi Virtual Cockpit is perhaps one of the most innovative features introduced within this segment in the last decade. If you haven't driven one yet, here's your chance! All of our listings include the following:

? All vehicles are no older than 24 months off the dealer's lot
? Freshly washed and vacuumed prior to your rental
? FREE curbside delivery and/or self-service at DFW or DAL (Lovefield) Airports**
? Pre-loaded NTTA TollPass for use in all of Texas &amp; Oklahoma

?????????? 2018 Audi A4 Edmunds.com review:
The 2018 Audi A4 delivers just about everything we expect from a small luxury sedan. There's quick acceleration, a comfortable ride, and the latest connectivity and navigation technologies. But the fact that it does it without overwhelming you makes it, at least for the time being, the car to get in the segment.

The A4 is a joy to drive, whether you're slicing your way through mountain switchbacks or just tackling your daily commute. On the inside, Audi's understated yet attractive interior design makes operating all of the many high-tech features easy, thanks to the intuitive MMI infotainment system and smartly placed physical buttons for more common functions. To top it off, the A4 also provides plenty of space and comfort for front and rear passengers, accommodating even taller adults in back.

Trust us, you'll want this car on your short list.

For everybody else who's not requesting the car for seven full days. You can always have the car at the Turo parking lot for FREE whether it's one day, one hour, one week, or one month please keep reading we are happy to give you the car without any strings attached. The only disadvantage is the hours of operation are from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. . so if your flight does not fit into that schedule then there's no way you can get the car -- 99.95% of the time it is cheaper to get into an Uber and than it is to  deliver the car directly to you. Hop off the plane and hop into the car. I'll have the AC running for you.

This is my 2017 Ford Mustang. 

This is is the only Mustang on Turo with UNLIMITED MILES. 



Feel free to cruise all of California with my car. The car runs and drives beautifully.  Everything works 100%, 

Some nice features are: 

Apple CarPlay - Plug your iPhone in and use your phone for navigation, music and more. 

Android Auto - Plug your Android device and use Google Maps, Waze or listen to music.  

Heated &amp; Cooled Seats - The cooled seats are awesome on a hot day. Toast your buns, or cool your cheeks. =)

Backup Cam - Pretty common today, but just wanted to mention it. 

Convertible Top - Most important feature of all. Cruse Southern California with the top down. Nothing comes close to this feeling, absolutely therapeutic, at lease for me =)


You will get the car with a full tank, please return it that way. If you don't return it with a full tank, you will be charged the remainder plus $10.

-Please take a moment to read.  Because it's a brand new car there are some rules and guidelines for renting this car. 

NOTE : When booking you are acknowledging that you fully accept.
• You will obey the traffic laws at all times.
• This car is lower than normal so be careful going in and out of the driveways. You are responsible for any damages.
• No speeding, no burn outs, no donuts and no launching allowed.
• Cannot take this car to the race track.
• No street racing or any other illegal activities.
• You are responsible for any exterior and interior damages.
• No pets, No smoking, No drinking allowed.
• Full the tank with 91 octane only, must leave receipts in center console YOU MUST SHOW THE RECEIPT AT THE END OF YOUR TRIP.
• You are responsible for any traffic or parking tickets during the rental period and all other liabilities. 

We like to keep the car in good condition and clean as possible for the next person who rents it. Please treat our car with respect . Thank you so much , hope you enjoy the ride !
There is a distinct difference between driving a car in a spiritedly manner and abusing/thrashing a car, this vehicle will be monitored via GPS and I have ZERO tolerance for abuse to this car. Enjoying Los Angeles's fun roads are fine but tire depth will be measured before and after each rental. Excessive wear will result in a charge for new tires through Turo. 

A $250 cleaning fee will be applied to your Turo Reservation if there is evidence of smoking, vaping, pets, or food. Not only do I use this car, others will too, appreciate being respectful.

There is a distinct difference between driving a car in a spiritedly manner and abusing/thrashing a car, this vehicle will be monitored via GPS and I have ZERO tolerance for abuse to this car. Enjoying Los Angeles's fun roads are fine but tire depth will be measured before and after each rental. Excessive wear will result in a charge for new tires through Turo. 

A $250 cleaning fee will be applied to your Turo Reservation if there is evidence of smoking, vaping, pets, or food. Not only do I use this car, others will too, appreciate being respectful.

Rediscover the joys of driving a simple car! There are many reasons why the Miata holds the Guiness world record as the best-selling roadster of all time, but the simple truth is - it's mad fun. It's a cult classic, a consummate antidote to road rage, a magic mood-lifter, a telepathic dance partner. It's the answer to... well, everything.

Whether you are a pathological car nut or just someone looking to enjoy a Sunday drive, this is your car. Since its debut in 1990 the Miata has evolved to keep up with the times. This one is a darn clean example of the very first year of the very first generation, the car that started it all: a burbly 1.6L four-cylinder, 50/50 weight distribution and a paltry 2,000 pounds to fling about on four skinny tires. And, of course, it's a manual and it's rear-wheel-drive.

The car is tiny. Driving through a sea of beige and gray, everything else on the road will seem like a bloated monstrosity. This can be weirdly amusing and you may catch yourself grinning silly. Don't be alarmed - this is normal. Especially if the top is down and the sun is out.

(I love driving new cars. If anyone is interested in swapping cars for a day or two let me know!)

Corvette Stingray Grand Sport!
Black on black exterior, with a beautiful RED interior. 

More than your average sports car, this Corvette is something special. You’ll grab attention everywhere you take it, and enjoy what most call America’s BEST Sports Car! 

For those unfamiliar with the Grand Sport... it’s the Stingray, but better! Much like it’s bigger brother the Z06, it carries the wide body design, upgraded wheels, bigger brakes, and a upgraded suspension. It truly takes the Corvette experience to the next level! 

This car truly speaks for itself. Take it out, and enjoy it for yourself... we promise, it’s one trip you won’t regret! 

Here’s a little more about the Corvette:
- It’s instantly powerful. Not recommend for the faint at heart

- 2 doors, and 2 seats 

- Yes it has a truck. It’s big enough for 3-4 standard duffel bags, or 1 big suitcase

- It has all the premium features you’ve come to expect: premium sound system, Bluetooth, and leather seats

- The stock exhaust is kind of loud. If that’s not your thing, this car isn’t for you

- It’s powerful V8, so MPGs are about 20-25 on the highway, and about 13-17 in the city 

- It’s very powerful. Experience handling high horsepower car is a must!

THIS IS MY 2018 Mercedes-Benz CLA 45 AMG 

It's a brand new car with only 22K miles.

The car is in excellent condition, drives remarkably and purrs beautifully.

Some Nice Features:

Navigation - Don't use your phones data. The car has built in navigation. 

Backup Camera - Pretty common today, but still wanted to mention it. 

Heated Seats - Warm up your butt on cold days. 

Apple Car Play - Plug in your phone and listen to music, take phone calls or have your texts read out loud. 

Android Auto - Use Google Maps, send a text message, or make phone calls. 


THIS VEHICLE IS NOT TO BE USED ON THE TRACK, 
IN THE CANONS OR IN ILLEGAL STREET RACING.

Don't drive recklessly with the car. Put it in sport mode and push the gas, its a ton of fun. Great adrenaline rush. Have fun and enjoy yourself, but don't do anything reckless like doing doughnuts, burning out, or racing other cars. 

I have remote monitoring and if I get a notification of driving erratically I will cancel the trip and require the car to be returned. 

You will get the car with a full tank, please return it that way.
If you don't return it with a full tank, you will be charged the remainder plus $10.  


I don't mind if you eat or drink in the car. 
Just clean up after yourself please. 
Cleaning fee will apply if returned with dirty. 


Please do not smoke in the car. 
Also no pets. 
Everything else just ask.

"Liberty Mutual",2016,los-angeles,"Seasons change, but in LA, they rarely do. So roll back the top and let the wind get in your hair. 

1) It’s a convertible! For starters you won’t mistake this Audi A5 for a Chrysler Sebring—well maybe at night, but probably the best thing about this A5 is that it’s a cabriolet. Living in Southern California—or any place with lots of great weather—a drop-top is a must for sun worshippers. The soft top drops in 15 seconds and closes in 18 seconds at speeds up to 31 mph. It’s not as well insulated as the tops you’ll find in most Mercedes-Benz cabriolets, but it is well stitched and insulated to provide a decent sound barrier when it is up.

2) The engine rocks. Sure, it only has four cylinders, but that’s all you really need—trust us. The A5’s turbo-four delivers 252 hp and 273 lb-ft of torque. It is well mated and synced to a super smooth seven-speed automatic transmission, moving around town with a 0-60 mph time of 6.0 seconds. And it gets decent gas mileage of 24/34 mpg city/highway miles to boot.

3) The interior is superb. The seats of the A5 are wrapped in tasty Nougat Black leather. It seats four passengers—two adults up front and two children (or a dog) in the rear—and offers 10-way adjustability with four-way lumbar support for the driver. Best feature are the A/C and heat blowers built into the headrests at neck level to keep you cool or toasty.",90068,none,5.0,"Gas (Premium)","['$$Use this link  https://turo.com/c/mikhailm39 for your first trip and get a discount $25 $$-= GRAB YOUR OPTIONAL EXTRAS AT THE CHECKOUT =-Not every Turo Guest follows guidelines to use hand wash and refuel the tank with the right grade of fuel during and at the trip-end.

20 Inch Forged Volk Racing Ultra Track Edition Wheels.

Custom Matte Charcoal Grey Color

Lexus, RC stands for “Radical Coupe.” That face certainly is, especially coming from a carmaker typically known for selling Camry-based snooze-inducing luxury SUVs.

The Lexus RC itself is a rear-drive coupe that was originally supposed to be the two-door version of the IS compact sport sedan, but ended up being an entirely different car much the same way the BMW 4 Series isn’t just a 3 Series with two fewer doors.

The RC goes even further. It isn’t a two-door IS, it was built using three— yes three—existing Lexus vehicles. It’s a god-damn Frankenstein. The front end was ripped out of the GS midsize sedan for handling purposes, says Lexus. 

The mid-section comes from the last generation IS convertible, for its chassis rigidity and short wheelbase, and the rear, well that’s all the current IS.

On to the RC-F: it’s heavily modified by Lexus’ F performance division, which isn’t quite AMG or M but still does interesting stuff. A naturally aspirated, 5.0-liter V8 and an eight-speed automatic transmission were dropped under its hood. 

19-inch BBS aluminum wheels, stickier rubber, a stiffer suspension, massive Brembo brakes, and cooling ducts were grafted all over its body to complete the performance package.
What you end up with is a juicy ragout of Lexus parts that holds together using new-age laser welding techniques and fancy adhesives.

The seats. OH MY GOD THE SEATS! Insanely comfortable. Stunningly attractive. Smooth. Soft. Warm. Cool. Aggressively bolstered and relaxing as hell. This is what Lexus does best; a car in which you could basically live in.

The cabin is as quiet as a vault, the suspension, when set to Normal mode, is soft and compliant. The Mark Levinson sound system is absolutely epic. It’s all beautifully well crafted in there, like a Lexus ought to be.

There’s no turbo lag, no laggy throttle response, just a raspy intake note with a satisfying growl released from the quad exhaust pipes has tons of grip, so the car hunkers down and launches hard.

The end result, according to Lexus, is 467 HP and 389 lb-ft of torque. Acceleration to 60 mph from a standstill is achieved in a claimed at 4.3 seconds.

Yet it does so with a face only Godzilla’s mother would love. Whatever you think of it, admit it: this thing looks like nothing else on the road at the moment.

But the fundamental reason why this car matters a lot, for me at least, is the fact that it’s the only fast luxury super-coupe out now that comes with a naturally aspirated V8. That’s becoming increasingly rare in the segment. Even Mercedes-AMG has dropped its 6.2-liter brute in favor of a twin-turbo V8.

The RC-F may look like it’s from 2045 Tokyo, but its drivetrain has one foot solidly grounded in the past. The RC-F has a trunk and it’s decently sized for grocery bags and other useless cargo you need to carry around. It’s daily-able.

A knob dial on the RC-F’s center console allows you to calibrate the car to different drive modes: Sport and Sport Plus. The latter is where you want your Gundam fighter jet on wheels to be, as it radically stiffens up the adjustable dampers, hardens the steering wheel and opens up the active exhaust. The interactive gauge cluster’s center tachometer changes color, increases the size of the fonts, and adds flashing shift bars on each side.

As the revs climb, the retractable carbon fiber wing pops up in the rear-view mirror, and the engine suddenly starts to bark, sounding twice as loud. Is this a simulated engine sound? It’s not. It’s a sign the intake noise flap has just opened. What I’m hearing is all motor. And it’s totally gratifying.

In the higher rev range, the engine note mutates into a deep, constant and linear mechanical bellow until that V8, seemingly unstressed, crosses the 7,300 RPM redline and hits the limiter in a Lexus-appropriate butter-smooth demeanor- GRAP - PEPAP. My ears are wet. Are they bleeding? No. They’ve just experienced an aural orgasm.

I pull the right paddle shifter, the automatic gearbox hands me over another gear on a silver platter. The RC-F tightens its necktie, and the entire process is repeated.

The BMW X1 goes far beyond utility, changing everything you know and expect from a Sports Activity Vehicle®. Awarded the IIHS Top Safety Pick with an Advanced front-crash avoidance rating – when equipped with optional front crash prevention – the X1 offers adventure and peace of mind. Add a suite of innovations and handling you would expect from a BMW, and it's easy to see why all aspects of this vehicle truly thrill.

A Sports Activity Vehicle® should do more than just get you there. It should thrill at every turn. You should feel the power of 228 horses barreling down the highway and expect a 0–60 time in as quick as 6.3 seconds, with an 8-speed Steptronic automatic transmission that simultaneously provides the optimal balance of acceleration and fuel consumption. Because that's just how BMW engineers a Sports Activity Vehicle.


POWERFUL ENGINES
THE HEART OF EVERY X1.

28i: BMW's mighty inline 4-cylinder TwinPower Turbo. Displacing just 2.0 liters, this 228-hp marvel generates 258 lb-ft of torque at just 1450 rpm, for potent thrust that kicks in right from the start and continues through 4500 rpm. Lightweight and smooth-running, it incorporates BMW's award-winning High Precision Direct Injection, Valvetronic and Double-VANOS technologies. This powerful combination produces the highest power output in its class.

?????????? 2018 Civic Edmunds.com review:
Equipped with the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, this car is one of the best cars in its class for delivering both impressive acceleration and high fuel economy. Inside, it has plenty of room for passengers, clever storage solutions and more cargo space than most competitors in any body style. It also offers technology features that put some other compact cars to shame and safety ratings that are among the best.

Thanks for checking out my Ford Fusion 

This car has athletic handling, and a roomy and comfortable interior.  It has a powerful turbocharged engine , a 1.5-liter 181 horsepower it's mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. The Fusion is also one of the most agile cars in its class, with handling that is sportier than many midsize sedans. It also features adjustable power steering that is crisp and precise. 

Both rows are comfortable for long drives and offer ample room for passengers to stretch out. There are two complete sets of LATCH child-seat connectors in the Fusion's second row. The middle seat is fitted with a dedicated tether anchor and can borrow lower anchors from either side. 

This car has a nice size screen with rear view camera and parking sensors to help you park perfectly. 

It is equipped with code entry so pickup and drop off can be flexible. Returning early or picking up late is not an issue at all as with some hosts.  If you choose pickup for your delivery method you will need to get to the pickup location.  I will not deliver the car anywhere if you choose pickup you must choose delivery to airport or to address you choose.  Pickup is free delivery is not except for longer term rentals which the app will show you.

***Cayman ""S"" on stick shifting action!

Not all Caymans are created equal.  This is the S-variant...the lean mean no-nonsense fast driving machine.  Checkered flag speed in true Porsche fashion.  This particular 2007 Cayman 987 S is legendary and evidently one of the best projects Porsche had ever pursued.  

Opinions are one thing, but facts are another...  
*This car laps the Nürburgring in 8 minutes 11 seconds, the 911 Carrera? 8 minutes 15 seconds.  
*In the 2007 Nürburgring 24 Hour race, it beat all flagship Porsches 997 GT3 RSR's, 997 GT3 Cup, and 996 GT3 Cup.

Rumor has it that Porsche didn't want to put a slightly bigger engine on the Cayman S because it would end up smoking the 911, and it's pretty believable when you drive the car (the 911 is only 0.2 of a second quicker, that's less than a half a second! On a straight road, not the windey ones we love so much!), it's seriously fast, responsive and maneuverable w/ it's mid-mounted engine and an amazing 50/50 weight ratio.  Engine right behind your seat...love it!  Resist the gravitational pull w/ it's superior lightweight platform engaging 0.29 coefficient of aerodynamic drag while you envelope yourself in its 11 speaker Bose system...while the car reaches 101mph - and you're only in 3rd gear!

That is the reason why we rebuilt this beast November 2017 to its' original glory with a $17k engine and $11K new brakes, clutch, fobs, ignition system and more.  Was it worth every penny?  You bet your A$$ it is!

Honestly I was never a Porsche fan until I drove this car, it's a serious experience.  Please drive w/ safety in mind, you are the car's most valuable luggage, thank you for considering our beloved interstate ballistic missile.  Please don't hesitate to contact us for any of your comfort needs! =)

If you're not familiar with the Cayenne you should know it comes in several available trim/engine models ranging from a base model 300hp V6 (which is what most on Turo are), to the 400hp V8 ""S"" model, to the 420hp V8 ""GTS"" we have, to the 500hp Turbo model.   The GTS version allows the driver to select multiple driving options such as adjusting the exhaust sounds levels, the ride height, ride comfort and shift point range. 

Fully loaded with Navigation, upgraded Burmester stereo (with Bluetooth audio/phone), heated &amp; air cooled seats, backup camera &amp; parking sensors, and rare panorama roof.  This sport SUV is a dream to drive with it's Porsche Active Suspension Management that you can adjust from Comfort, Normal, and Sport which lowers the vehicle almost a full 1"" and stiffens up the suspension to make it feel like a sports car!  

This is a VERY Fast and Fun SUV to drive, hitting 0-60 in just over 5 seconds with it's 420 horsepower V8 barking out a loud throaty growl.  The car has sensors that will store bad driving, crashes, engine data, opening of the hood, with date and time stamps so don't drive drunk, cause wrecks, abuse the car, etc because I will get a full report. 

BRAND NEW LISTING! INTRODUCTORY PRICE WONT LAST LONG (increased once already).  To get started on reviews we are listing the car very low, take advantage while you can, this car is practically new as it's a 2013 with super low miles.

Happy driving and I'm glad I could help make your Atlanta trip smoother, more affordable and fun.  I want you to have the best possible experience and 100% satisfaction.

"Liberty Mutual",2017,atlanta,"Meet Niki. 2007 BMW Z4 coupe. These E86 coupes were limited in production from 2006-2008, and they have achieved cult status among BMW enthusiasts. Combining a sleek fixed-roof coupe with the potent 3.0L naturally-aspirated N52 engine, BMW created a pure driver’s car with the Z4 coupe. 

Unlike the more powerful 3.2L M-powered coupes, this Z4 coupe is equipped with an automatic transmission, allowing the car to be driven by anyone. This car provides a sporting drive with little compromise. Despite the neutral grey color, this car turns heads and brings joy to children, and is incredibly rare to see. This car loves backcountry roads during the day, and it spends a lot of time parked outside of trendy bars and clubs in the evening. 

Avoid airport delivery fees! The car is located across the street from Midtown MARTA station - a 25-minute, $2.50/person, direct ride from the airport.

Note this car has limited storage space in the back: two pieces of luggage that can fit in an airliner overhead bin can fit, but not much more. This is a perfect weekend car: two people, two getaway bags, and 6 cylinders reminding you of what BMW is capable of at their best.

200 miles per day! Spend the weekend in the mountains or cruise to the beach for a week. Reasonable overage rates are available. Minimum rental length may apply; please contact me if you need the car for a different length of time and we’ll try to accommodate as best we can (you can always book for two days and return the car early).

This car has an old-school sound system. As the Z4 was built more for the driving experience, in-cabin entertainment was an afterthought. I have fitted the car with a 9V - USB converter device for phone chargers, and the car comes with a 3.5mm audio jack to Apple lightning cable adapter to allows you to play music or GPS instructions from Apple devices via the stereo’s AUX input. Both of these are provided for the convenience of all of our guests. Please enjoy responsibly. Removal of either device will subject the guest to a fee of 15$ per device. 

Great, reliable commuter car - 26 mpg highway and a smooth, comfortable ride even at 80 mph. Please note that this - like most older cars on Turo - is a 10 year-old German car with more than 100k miles. We take great care of the car, having spend thousands in repairs and preventative maintenance to keep it going. However, as with all cars - especially more ""mature"" cars like this - things can go wrong. Rest assured the owner is responsive to issues that may arise, and all of our cars are eligible for Turo's roadside assistance program. This is not meant to scare you away, rather, just an attempt to create fair expectations - many Turo cars are of similar age/mileage, but few are in as good condition or as well-maintained as this car. Should an issue arise do not hesitate to contact us.",30309,none,5.0,"Gas (Premium)","[""Just a few rules of engagement to note: (1) absolutely no smoking/vaping/drug use or pets, (2) please return full of fuel (minimum 91 octane) and provide receipt from last fill-up (failure to do so will result in 15$ fee) (3) don't leave trash in the car, (4) do not wash the car's exterior (vacuuming the interior is ok and welcome) (5) do not use the automated toll roads as this car is not registered, (6) do not track, autocross, drag race, or otherwise drive the car in a competitive nature (whether against the clock or other drivers) - this can be arranged outside of Turo with an additional fee due to the increased wear & tear, insurance requirements, and the fact that it is against Turo TOS. Failure to abide by any of these could subject the renter to additional fees. Put simply: treat the car kindly :)I will not hand over keys if the name on your license does not match the guest name provided by Turo. At check-in, we will walk the car together and I will point out all existing damage, documented with photos uploaded to Turo. This car uses GPS tracking to monitor its location.

Get $25OFF your first rental, go to www.TryTuro.com

Our Vanderhall Venice is our favorite car and we’re sure that you’ll love it too. It has an amazing exhaust and turbo sound that will definitely turn heads. This car is the perfect beach cruiser and there’s nothing better to drive up and down PCH with. You’ll get more attention than the Lamborghini’s and Ferrari’s that you pass in the street. 

What makes this 3 wheeler unique, is it’s heater (which makes it perfect for date night), seat warmers, large glass windshield, and it’s automatic transmission. There’s no other 3wheel vehicle with these options. As a female, these options are a must if riding in the evening. 

Helmets are required and we have a few available upon request.

This means that if the car is lost, stolen, or damaged so extensively that the expected cost of repairs exceeds 75% of the actual cash value, the renter is responsible to pay the entire actual cash value of the car, plus all Related Costs, minus any residual salvage value. *Many people believe that they have full coverage through a personal insurance policy or credit card.

For LAX Airport this is not a direct airport delivery at the gate It is renter’s responsibility to get to the pick up location and return location. The location is 1.5 mils only a 10 min Uber/Lyft drive from lax airport super convenient for travelers. But if you prefer LAX terminal gate delivery to avoid spending time and Uber/Lyft fee to get to the car, we do have this option with delivery fee. Please choose Guest's chosen location delivery for pick up and return location and set the location as 1 World Way Los Angeles ca 90045  (You can text me the exactly terminal to delivery the vehicle) 

We Highly recommend booking the vehicle without delivery and Ubering yourself to the vehicle, this will save both of us a good amount of time! (and is much cheaper).

Take advantage of this NEW LISTING (turo doesn’t event have it ready for app input!)

?? This is a beautiful Loaded 2019 G550. The Mercedes-Benz G-Class is the automotive equivalent of, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" The iconic Geländewagen has been around since 1979, with only evolutionary updates keeping it fresh over the past four decades. It's weird and wild, and there's nothing else quite like it.

With a pedigree so storied, the G Class is a true legend of the road.

It has an ubiquitous 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine, tuned here to deliver 416 horsepower and 450 pound-feet of torque. That's more than enough hustle to get this big, four-wheel-drive brute up and moving with a quickness. Mercedes estimates the 0-60 miles per hour time at under 6 seconds

The G Class comes with a 12.3-inch infotainment display, front and center, set back in the dash.

- ventilated seats 
- apple play

This isn’t your everyday Dodge Charger, this is a Hellcat! 

It Sounds amazing, it’s insanely fun to drive, and a little scary... all at the same time. This is one Turo trip you won’t forget! White on gun metal gray wheels wrapped in Pirelli tires. 

A loaded 2018 with almost every option.

Here’s a little more about the Hellcat:

- It’s instantly powerful. Not recommend for the faint at heart

- Four doors provides plenty of room for up to 4 adults

- The trunk is huge, so it’ll hold suitcases and that kinda of stuff 

- It has all the premium features you’ve come to expect: Navigation, 15 speaker sound system, Satellite radio, Bluetooth, and leather seats

- The stock exhaust is kind of loud. If that’s not your thing, this car isn’t for you

- It’s supercharged V8, so MPGs are about 18-20 on the highway, and about 13-15 in the city 

- It’s very powerful. Experience handling high horsepower car is a must! 

- BONUS: It comes with the 'Red Key' unlocking 707hp!!!

?????????? 2018 Civic Edmunds.com review:
Equipped with the turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine, this car is one of the best cars in its class for delivering both impressive acceleration and high fuel economy. Inside, it has plenty of room for passengers, clever storage solutions and more cargo space than most competitors in any body style. It also offers technology features that put some other compact cars to shame and safety ratings that are among the best.

The top goes down at a push of one button. Just  hold the button until till top is completely stowed. The car will tell you it is complete. However, in the trunk, there is a black flap that must be connected. It separates the trunk from the soft top storage area. If that black flap is not hooked up/ attached then the top will think something is wrong and it will not go up or down. You must first attach it. Do not store luggage in the soft top storage area or soft top will not work. Put luggage in back seat of car. 

It takes about 10 seconds for down and another 10 seconds for up.

I have two dent protectors on the back seat or trunk of car. I use those for when parked to protect the doors from being dented. They are easy to put on. They attach to car by magnet and the cable goes on top of car door as you close it. Please consider using then. 

Here is link to see demo of dent protectors for side doors. They are in trunk of car.

The car offers spacious, comfortable ride for five people with the smoothness and power rivaling the President's limo.  Planning a long trip - this is the best vehicle for it!  And yet it is surprisingly agile thanks to its powerful V-8 engine, super light power steering and tight turning radius.  While it already has plenty of cargo space, you can fold down the rear seat and get a flat area the size of a full bed. The wagon has the same platform/length as the longest edition of a Chevy Suburban.  Its large windows are great for navigating in traffic and sightseeing. 

The car is fully loaded with all modern amenities such as ABS, power windows and locks, power and heated seats with adjustable height, tilt and lumbar support, A/C with climate control, cruise control, variable power assist steering, etc.  Most importantly, the tape adapter is included so you can listen to your iPhone, iPod or maybe even Zune in addition to FM radio.

Please note that any weekend day rental requires a two-day rental or more.

Kick it up a notch and swag with this holy black grail of luxury.  Just 12 seconds and your cruising topless!  With its Red-Race exterior design, the Batmobile will surely have a run for its money to keep up with this puppy's performance!  This car has pure exotic lines of class act, and aesthetics that assures you’ll get the right attention you deserve - like a VIP that you are!

According to Car and Driver Magazine, the F-TYPE JAG was allegedly endorsed by Enzo Ferrari as the most beautiful car ever created. With historical designs from the classic C-TYPE, the Jaguar racer that won LeMans in 1953, it continuous its powerful engagement with timeless aesthetic appeal coupled with a potent engine ready for you to zoom to your next tea time appointment.

Turn heads all over LA in this LIKE NEW automated overdrive transmission performance loaded loaded...Did I say loaded 4C Spider occupies a totally unique space within the FCA garage as a pure sports car. A two-seater with a removable cloth Targa-style top, 4C’s mid-engine/rear-wheel drive layout defines it as an exotic automobile.

4C begins with a monocoque structure as a platform, much like high end sports cars like the McLaren 12C. A tub built of carbon fiber, aluminum and other lightweight materials forms the basis for the 4C, defining the passenger compartment. Suspension, steering, engine, transmission and other body parts get bolted or bonded to the tub. A stiff, low, wide vehicle results, wearing a gorgeously curvy skin.

The 4C is seductive, sexy, and highly desirable. The Suede and Leather Yellow stitched interior is stunning. It’s yellow pant and black powder coated wheels will turn heads!

Everyone wants a look at this street legal track car! ??  Has a MSRP of over $85k

237HP and 258lbs of torque take this lightweight ?? 0-60mph in around (4) seconds!

If you want to experience what big performance was in 1990, like shifting your own gears and hearing a V8 rumble you'll love this car. 

Totally unique and I doubt you'll find another like it anywhere for rent. 

Please contact me with any questions and I'll be glad to answer as well as work out any pick-up/delivery options.

TIPS:
* Higher speeds decrease range.  Drive below 70mph (namely for long distances).
* Keep A/C about 73+.  A/C usage affects long range.  &lt;300wh is optimal.
* If planning for long trips please let me know, I can suggest a planning app.. I drove from Chicago to Dallas for $0

Pitch black Challenger fitted with 20” satin bronze golden wheels. I wanted to put out a car that was a little different than the usual black on black (which I have 4 of in my fleet). I tried many different combinations on this body and these wheels accentuate the style line defined by the rich color and clean angles of the challenger.
