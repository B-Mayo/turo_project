I love BMWs for their sports car steering & handling, their driver-oriented cockpits, and the distinctive styling features. I love to make cars part of my experiences both in everyday life and travel. I seek out new cars to drive, and love seeing different places from the road. Some of my all-time favorite drives include the Pacific Coast Highway north of San Francisco and the roads up and down the mountains on the Amalfi Coast. I aim to serve all guests, but I’ve found that three groups of guests are most suited for my cars: auto enthusiasts looking to enjoy the North Georgia mountains, business travellers looking for an upgrade from the rental agencies boring eco-boxes, and out of town visitors looking for a nice ride to enjoy Atlanta in. I work with my wife to provide the best service possible. For airport deliveries, this means in-person curbside delivery. For pickup, cars are stored across the street from a MARTA station. For in-town deliveries, we are happy to accommodate your preferred pick up location. For all trips, you can expect prompt and courteous communications, a fair price, and well cared-for vehicles.

https://turo.com/drivers/2381072,0,1,0,"Peer Automotiv (recently recognized as a TURO POWER HOST) was formed by a couple of guys from the Midwest who grew tired of the archaic, signature intensive, complicated process associated with renting a vehicle. When traveling for work, driving for pleasure, or just needing a vehicle for a few days while our car was in the shop, we came to realize that a simple, streamlined experience of renting a vehicle failed to exist. Today’s extensive rental process often inconveniences us with Ubers or shuttle rides to the rental car’s location, waiting in long lines to check in, filling out extensive paperwork, and dancing through the insurance coverage process to obtain whatever vehicle is available in the prior selected ‘rental size’ category at an often-unreasonable daily price (run-on sentence much? Clearly, we're passionate). This, in addition to an elaborate rental return process, always left us frustrated and filled with anxiety associated with the extensive amount of time it takes to pick up and drop off a vehicle. Worst of all, we were often mailed toll charges weeks after the vehicle rental, creating yet another inconvenience to go online and pay without penalty. Growing tired of the entire outdated rental experience, our co-founders Jordan Jakubov and Chris Short decided to leverage their 18 years' experience in the automotive industry and create a premium, customer-centric, peer-to-peer vehicle rental experience through Turo’s platform. Peer Automotiv has eliminated the rental car front desk and the inconvenience it causes customers by focusing on three key components currently lacking in the traditional rental car industry: ?? Convenience ?? Value ?? Simplicity After all, a rental car experience should be simple and enjoyable, not complicated and time consuming. At Peer Automotiv, we provide customers with high-end vehicles accompanied by a great price and seamless rental process. Be sure to check out our newly added luxury vehicles, at prices you won't find anywhere else!

They made a circle with random objects such as a dictionary, a set of keys, a pen, a toy hammer, a toy car, etc..... They placed baby me in the middle and watched which object I went towards. The object I chose was supposed to be my career in life. I chose the car. Ever since I can remember I loved cars. I am very excited to rent out my cars on Turo.
